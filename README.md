**Vision statement**

I am working with people studying/researching/working in the Data Science/AI space to co-create a series of useful online learning opportunities. The main goal is to ensure that people anywhere have access to high quality resources that are truly useful to help them improve their practice, build their skills and contribute positively to the wider discourse.
